			<h3>Rules</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>If X played in the top-right corner of the local board, O is forced to play their next move in the top-right local board.</li>
				<li>Each small 3-by-3 tic-tac-toe board is referred to as a local board, and the larger 3-by-3 board is referred to as the global board.</li>
				<li>The game starts with X playing wherever they want in any of the 81 empty spots. </li>
				<li>This move 'sends' their opponent to its relative location.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>For example, if X played in the top right square of their local board, then O needs to play next in the local board at the top right of the global board.</li> 
						<li>O can then play in any one of the nine available spots in that local board, each move sending X to a different local board.</li>
					</ul>
				<li>If a move is played so that it is to win a local board by the rules of normal tic-tac-toe, then the entire local board is marked as a victory for the player in the global board.</li>
				<li>Once the outcome of a local board is decided (win or draw), no more moves may be played in that board. If a player is sent to such a board, then that player may play in any other board.</li>
				<li>Game play ends when either a player wins the global board, or there are no legal moves remaining.</li>
